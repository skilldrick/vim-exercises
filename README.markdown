Vim Exercises
=============

These exercises are meant to be used alongside vimtutor, in order to
get more practice with the commands taught. Open vimtutor in one instance
of Vim, and `vim_ex.txt` in another instance. Most lessons in vimtutor
will have an equivalent exercise in `vim_ex.txt`, except for those where
it doesn't really make sense to have a separate exercise.

To start vimtutor, run `vimtutor` from a terminal. To open the 
`vim_ex.txt` file in Vim, `cd` to the directory containing the file and
run `vim vim_ex.txt`.
